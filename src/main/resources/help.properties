what_is_workspace=What is a workspace?
what_is_workspace_answer=A workspace stores all the submissions from a piece of coursework or other assignment given to your students that you would like to check against plagiarism. Once all the submissions have been uploaded, you are then able to run a template which will run a pre-defined set of detectors to find instances of plagiarism between the submissions uploaded.

check_online=Will my submissions be checked for plagiarism against online sources or submissions from previous years?
check_online_answer=At the moment Sherlock only checks for plagiarism between submissions in the workspace being analysed.

analysis_time=How long will analysis take?
analysis_time_answer=It is not possible to answer this question as it depends on a number of factors including: the speed of your computer, the number of submissions in the workspace and the computational requirements of the detector(s) being ran. <br /><br />If there are is a large number of submissions and/or complex detectors are being ran, such as the N-Gram Detector, it is likely to take some time.

analysis_frozen=Analysis seems to have frozen, what can I do?
analysis_frozen_answer=Due to the high computational requirements of plagiarism detection it is very likely that analysis will take a long time. Before interrupting Sherlock, please wait an hour to see if there has been any progress. If there has been some process, it is likely that this task will take a long time to complete; if you require results sooner: run Sherlock on a more powerful machine, reduce the number of submissions being analysed or disable the computationally expensive detectors. If there has been no progress, cancel the task in the queue or close Sherlock and try again; if the problem persists, please contact the developers <a href="https://github.com/DCS-Sherlock/Sherlock/issues" target="_blank">here</a>.

no_active_detectors=I've attempted to run a template, but it says "there are no active detectors". What does this mean?
no_active_detectors_answer=This means that the template you are running does not have any detectors selected so no analysis will be started. Please update the template or contact the owner of the template (if it is public) to fix the issue.

another_question=I've got another question that is not answered here
another_question_answer=If you have another question please visit the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/DCS-Sherlock/Sherlock/wiki" target="_blank">Wiki</a> or view the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/DCS-Sherlock/Sherlock/issues" target="_blank">issues</a>. <br /><br />If this instance of Sherlock is running on a server, please contact the admin/webmaster who may be able to help you.

what_is_template=What is a template?
what_is_template_answer=A template stores a list of detectors you want to run and allows you to customise the parameters for each detector. Each template can then be ran on any workspace as long as the workspace and template languages match.

delete_submission=What happens if I delete a submission?
delete_submission_answer=If you delete a submission all results that involve the submission will no longer be available. Therefore, please ensure that you no longer need the results, or have printed the reports out, before deleting any submissions in a workspace you need the results from.

delete_template=Will my results be affected if I modify or delete a template?
delete_template_answer=No results will be affected if you modify or delete a template. Please note that if you re-run a results set it will not use the updated template parameters.

register=How do I register an account?
register_answer=No accounts are needed if you are running Sherlock locally, you should be logged in automatically. If Sherlock is running on a server, it is not possible to register for an account yourself; you must contact the admin/webmaster to create an account for you.

forgot_password=I've forgotten my password, how can I reset it?
forgot_password_answer=Please contact the admin/webmaster who will be able to reset your password for you.
