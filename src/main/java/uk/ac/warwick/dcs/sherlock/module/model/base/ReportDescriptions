//Lines starting with // are ignored; so are blank lines
//Lines starting with :: denote a DetectionType enum

//Changing Comments or formatting
::COMMENT
Lines %1$d to %2$d in file A contain comments that are identical to lines %3$d to %4$d in file B.

//Changing Identifiers
::IDENTIFIER
The code in lines %1$d to %2$d in file A is identical to the code in lines %3$d to %4$d in file B, except that the identifiers have different names.

//Changing the order of operands in expressions
::OPERAND_ORDER
The expression at line %1$d to %2$d of file A is equivalent to the expression at line %3$d to %4$d of file B. The order that the operands are written in has been changed, but the result is the same.

//Changing Data Types
::DATA_TYPE
Variable X of file A is used in all the same ways as variable P of file B, but it is stored as a slightly different data type. This does not make a significant difference on the result however, and lines %1$d to %2$d of file A and lines %3$d to %4$d of file B are suspiciously similar.
